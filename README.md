Questions:
----------

1. Do public schools within the CA boundaries have nearby access to recreational facilities like parks and pools for after
school activities to incentivize further learning and healthy living? 
2. How can CA target specific parks closest to local schools as a means of getting kids involved in healthy physical fitness
activities through before, after school and summer programs?
